# Zomato-project
The Zomato dataset contains information about restaurants listed on the Zomato platform across various cities. It includes details such as restaurant names, locations, cuisines, ratings, average costs, and more.
I worked on a Zomato dataset where I performed data cleaning, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). I handled missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured the data was ready for analysis. I also created various visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and histograms to extract meaningful insights from the data.
